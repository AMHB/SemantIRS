# SemantIRS: IRS-Enhanced Semantic Offloading for Intelligent Transportation Systems

**Developer:** Ali Mehrban

---

## Overview

This repository contains all simulation codes, architectural assets, LaTeX tables, figures, and workflow diagrams for the SemantIRS frameworkâ€”a state-of-the-art architecture that combines Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS) with edge-deployed lightweight LLMs and semantic offloading, optimized for Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGIN) in next-generation Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).

- **SemantIRS** provides robust low-latency V2X connectivity, 82.6% latency reduction, 12dB IRS SNR gain, and 90% bandwidth savings validated through journal-level Python simulations.

## How to Reproduce Simulation Results

1. **Set up the Python environment**  
   - Requires Python 3.8+, numpy, pandas, matplotlib
   - (Optional: Jupyter Notebook for interactive runs)

2. **Run the main simulation script**  
   - Generates all baseline and optimized performance results
   - Outputs: `FINAL_OPTIMIZED_results.csv`, `FINAL_OPTIMIZED_comparison.csv`, and plots

3. **Open/modify draw.io diagrams**  
   - Use included `*.xml` files with [draw.io](https://draw.io) for custom visualizations

4. **Insert figures and tables**  
   - Provided as ready-to-use LaTeX tabular/code or figure PNGs
